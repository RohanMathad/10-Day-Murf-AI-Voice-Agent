# **Day 8 – Voice Game Master (Sci-Fi Adventure)**

### **Echoes of Titan-Prime – Real-time Voice-Driven RPG**

## ✅ **What I Built**

* Created a **voice-only Game Master** that runs an interactive sci-fi survival story.
* Designed a **new universe** — *Echoes of Titan-Prime* — instead of using the standard fantasy D&D example.
* The GM narrates scenes, asks for actions, remembers choices, and guides the story.

## ✅ **How It Works**

* Story controlled entirely through **voice conversation**.
* Player speaks actions → agent resolves them → story continues.
* Uses only **chat history + lightweight world map** for continuity.
* Supports:

  * Scene switching
  * Inventory items
  * Journaling of key events
  * Choice-based branching
  * Restarting the adventure

## ✅ **Tech Used**

* **LiveKit Agents**
* **Gemini LLM** for narration
* **Deepgram STT** for speech input
* **Murf Falcon TTS** for ultra-fast voice output
* **Silero VAD + Turn Detection**
* Fully custom front-end with **sci-fi themed UI**

## ✅ **UI Enhancements**

* New **Titan-Prime themed welcome screen**
* New **Session View** with:

  * Sci-fi background
  * Particle overlays
  * Glass blurred chat window
  * Neon cyan accents

## ✅ **What the Demo Shows**

* Starting the Titan-Prime adventure
* Player exploring a crashed pod, ruins, signals
* Story reacting in real time to voice input
* Mini-arc completion when the power core is restored
