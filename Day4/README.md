# **Day 4 – Voice-Based Java & DSA Active Recall Tutor**

This project implements a fully interactive **voice AI tutor** that teaches Java and DSA concepts using three dynamic learning modes. Each mode switches to a dedicated Murf Falcon voice and adapts its behavior in real time.

## 🚀 Features

### 🎧 **Learn Mode (Matthew)**

Explains the selected Java/DSA topic clearly using structured summaries.

### ❓ **Quiz Mode (Alicia)**

Asks active-recall questions to test understanding.

### 🗣️ **Teach-Back Mode (Ken)**

Listens to your explanation, evaluates it, and gives a score with feedback.

## 📘 Course Content (JSON Driven)

A lightweight `cs_content.json` file powers all learning topics:

* Java Basics
* OOP
* Collections
* Arrays & Strings
* Functions
* DSA Intro

## 🔊 Voice Experience

Powered by **Murf Falcon TTS**, each mode introduces itself with a custom voice personality.
