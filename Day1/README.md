# 🎙️ Day 1 — Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge

This is my **Day 1 project** for the Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge.

## ⭐ What I Built Today
A complete **real-time voice agent** using:

- 🧠 **Google Gemini** — LLM for generating intelligent responses  
- 🎧 **Deepgram** — Speech-to-text  
- 🔊 **Murf Falcon** — Ultra-fast text-to-speech  
- 🔗 **LiveKit** — Real-time audio pipeline  
- 💻 **Next.js Frontend** — Voice UI with microphone streaming  

## 🚀 What It Can Do
- Listens to the user’s voice  
- Converts it to text  
- Processes with Gemini  
- Responds immediately using Murf Falcon  
- Works entirely in real-time  

## 🗂️ How To Run (Local)
1. Start LiveKit server  
2. Run backend:
